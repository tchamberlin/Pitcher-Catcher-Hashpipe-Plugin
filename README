This is the Pitcher Catcher example Hashpipe plugin. It is intended to be used only as a guide to developing your own plugin; it has no intrinsic utility.

There is a full guide for installing this plugin located here: https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/GB/Software/CreatingAHashpipePlugin

When you build this plugin, make sure that you are installing your plugin to the hashpipe installation directory.
For example, I installed hashpipe to "/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall" using "./configure --prefix=/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall".
So, when I install the fake_gpu plugin, I will also install it to /home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall.
I will use $INSTALLDIR to refer to this common installation directory.

To build:
    From the root of Pitcher-Catcher-Hashpipe-Plugin:
        $ mkdir build config
        $ autoreconf -is
        $ cd build
        $ ../configure --prefix=$INSTALLDIR --with-hashpipe=$INSTALLDIR
        $ make
        $ make install

To run:
    After adding $INSTALLDIR to your PATH:
        $ clean_ipc; taskset 0x0606 hashpipe -p pitcher_catcher -I 3 -o BINDHOST=px1-2.gb.nrao.edu -o GPUDEV=0 -o XID=0 -c 2 pitcher_thread -c 3 catcher_thread
